//! \def REPORT_ERROR(a,b) is used to give feedback on true error conditions. Currently this is done via
//!      a simple printf(). In the future this needs to be made into a more formal throw of an exception.
//!
//! \todo REPORT_ERROR furthermore does not allow for flexible use of variable args lists currently. To change
//!       this would be quite helpful as well.

//! \class ThreadSingle
//!
//! \brief Base class to be inherited for spawning a single workerBee() pure virtual.
//!        For multiple threads, use ThreadMultiple instead.
//!
//! Details: Simply inherit this class and create your own workerBee() function in the parent.
//!   Then, use startThread() to start the new thread which will call your workerBee from the newly
//!   created thread. When it is time to shutdown, simply call stopThread() and when it returns, you're done.
//!   \note It is important to note that your implementation of workerBee() must be looking for the isStopRequested
//!         flag to signal it to return() - otherwise the thread class will not end nicely and will crash upon
//!         a change of scope and stack.
//!   \par
//!   Also, there is a built in single mutex created at instantiation time. Parent may pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex) and
//!         then can pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex) or even using signal/wait actions as well.
//!
//! \todo Clean up error reporting by using throw of a new type of exception - gui and console and logging automatically.
