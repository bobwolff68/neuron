//! \section section_one Common Purpose
//! It is our goal to provide a common set of libraries/classes which will aid in both ease
//! of development as well as re-use of code here at XVDTH. Each class herein should be well
//! documented in doxygen format, be written in the most platform-non-specific ways possible
//! and list its dependencies clearly.
//!
//! \section another_section Usage
//! Note that if you're class/code cannot be made portable when originally authored, it needs
//! to be able to be 'compiled-out' of the library via a <b>\#define SKIP_<CODENAME></b> to be placed
//! in skipfiles.h.
