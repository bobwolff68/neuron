              AVC/SVC/MVC Codec/Decoder SDK for Windows/Mac/Linux

                         Build Instructions

Visual Studio
-------------
SDK includes sample solution for Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 (see "src/samples.sln").
Codec libraries folder is "lib".
There are following configurations:

a) Release
This configuration uses static release libraries with prefix "w32i". Resulting
executables could be found under "/bin" folder.

b) Debug
This configuration uses static debug libraries with prefix "w32i". Resulting
executables could be found under "/src/Debug/" folder.

c) Release.Eval
This configuration uses static evaluation libraries with prefix "w32ie".
Resulting executables could be found under "/bin/" folder.

Please note that there are no eval libraries in production version of SDK, so
"Release.Eval" configuration could not be built.
And vice versa: there are only eval libraries in evaluation version of SDK and
only "Release.Eval" configuration could be built.


GNU-based build
---------------
The build procedure is based on GNU tools such as make, nasm, gcc. In general
it allows for a large variety of platforms and different behaviors support.

Recommended usage is:
	make

This command produces binary samples in ../bin directory, note in that case
is used simplified samples names like sample_enc, sample_dec etc.

Optional arguments for make:
	V4LIB	- specify explicit codec library file (by default is used first library
		from ../lib/ directory), note if V4LIB is set then samples names
		will contain library prefix (e.g. sample_enc-l32ie-all-mt);
	V4CC	- override default compiler (cl.exe, gcc);
	V4LINK  - override default linker (link.exe, gcc);
	V4OPTS  - additional options for compiler;

Examples:
	# V4LIB is useful if ../lib directory contains several libraries
	# or library is placed in other location then ../lib
	make V4LIB=../lib/libv4codecsdk-w32i-all-mt.lib

	# V4CC V4LINK V4OPTS permits to use non standard compiler, linker
	# or specify extra options (e.g. Intel runtime)
	make V4CC=icc V4LINK=xilink V4LIB=../lib/libv4decsdk-l64ie-all-mt.a V4OPTS=-L/opt/intel/Complier/lib

Overview
--------
Make files are configured to generate output executable files
using either Intel or GNU C compiler. SDK libraries are compiled using Intel C compiler.
Intel runtime library could be pointed out by using "LIB" environment variable
or by putting Intel runtime into "lib-icc32" or "lib-icc64" directories at the
same level as codec sdk persists:
lib-icc32/
lib-icc64/
v4sdk-4.5/

Ask support for "lib-icc32.tar.gz" or "lib-icc64.tar.gz" redistributables.

Mac OS specific
---------------
Please note that there are only dynamic runtime libraries under Mac OS.
Also we currently use only GCC for Mac builds.
Snow Leopard (10.6) OS is supported, previous versions could encounter
backward compatibility problems.

Decoder SDK
-----------
There are only decoder libraries and samples in this package.
Use following make targets:
	dec	- sample decoder;
	ana	- sample analyzer;
